# Personalized Wine Menu
Knowledge Engineering and Business Intelligence project about an international restaurant.

## Description
With COVID-19 many restaurants have their menus digitized. Guests can scan a QR code and have the menu presented on their smartphones. A disadvantage is that the screen is very small, and it is difficult to get an overview. This is especially true if a restaurant offers a big wine menu.
Usually customers have preferences. Some prefer wine only from a specific country, e.g. Italy, or a  specific region like Lombardy. Others exclude or prefer specific grapes, e.g.
Some donâ€™t like Pinot Noir. 
Most people are not wine experts and would like to select their wine by describing the taste (i.e. dry/not-dry, tannin/less-tannin) but a very prominent decision influencer is the meal. Red wine usually is offered to meat dishes; white wine usually to fish. But there are exceptions, e.g. white wine with chicken. 

The objective of the project is to represent the knowledge about wines. 
Menus and guest preferences are needed to support the selection process (i.e. they are input). 
The aim is to create a system that allows to select those wines that fit the guest preferences and the menu.
The knowledge base contains information about typical wines (of an international restaurant) with wines from different regions and countries. 


## Task
The objective of this project is to build a knowledge-based system that represents information about wines typically found in international restaurants, with inputs and outputs. The system utilize input such as menus and guest preferences to support the wine selection process. 

Three main knowledge-based solutions are implemented based on: 
  - Decision Tables with Camunda Modeler;
  - Prolog Algorithm;
  - Knowledge Graph in Protege.
These solutions enable the system to provide tailored recommendations based on user input.

In addition, a graphical modeling language, through the ADOxx Metamodelling Platform, is designed to allow chefs to visually represent meals and wines, adding all relevant information required for customers to make informed choices based on their preferences.
